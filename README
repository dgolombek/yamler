Yamler - Making YAML easy and fun to use with Ruby
=========================================================================

Using YAML in Ruby is pretty easy, but I find myself doing several things
every time I use YAML. First is I always seem to pass it through ERB. The
other is that I want to pass it a binding, because I want to give it
access to some variables or methods. Finally I sometimes end up merging
several YAML files into one file, because other wise it would be too big
and unwieldy to manage. Enter Yamler:

=== Examples:
  # This will read the file in, parse it through ERB, and then run it
  # through YAML#load
  Yamler.load('/path/to/file.yml')
